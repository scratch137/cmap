    comap_190801d_APP.s19:
    Changed bus expander initialization for DCM2 ADC from ouput port to
    input port with same "readBEX" function as most other devices.
    This will reduce noise sensitivity (although all lines have pullups)
    and may help with random attenuator shifts.

    Changes
    - Added fairly primitive "set all power" (option p in all and jall).  This
      is a simple loop over all rx, bands, and I/Q, without locking of the
      overall loop (calls to individual setPow have internal locks, though).
    - Fixed logic in power loop; moved convergence tests to end.

    - Reverted to comap_20180420 to remove extra CS low (but had to remove it
      manually anyway)
    - Modified argus_init for manual selection of bias or dcm2 system;
      auto-identify doesn't seem to work at OVRO for dcm2, although it seems
      ok for the bias system
    - Added definition FOUNDLNABIASSYS to argusHardwareStructs.h to control
      manual selectoin of bias and dcm2
    - Labeled this release 20180430b to indicate bias selection

    TOTPWR RETURNS (I AND Q, NOT JUST Q)
    - Previous dcm2 problem was a loose wire, so previous commit will work
      fine in the lab.
    - Change here is DCM2 BEX returned to 0x20 for DCM2 module, from 0x21
      for lab.
    - Minor format change in ENGR read-back manual screen.

    Getting there...
    - Changed bias/dcm2 detect to look for bias power card BEX.  This works.
    - Changed "noDCM2" to "foundLNAbiasSys"
    - In initializations, replaced open and close bus subroutines with
      hard-coded opens and closes so i2cBusBusy locks out external requests
      (e.g. monitoring) during initialization.  Or most of initialization;
      DCM2 initial readouts may be affected.
    - Some format cleanup to declutter manual screens depending on which
      system is connected.
    - But now need to track down why DCM2 init has stopped working properly.
      Main board ok, but can't detect test module.

    Getting there, but still an odd problem: bias system hangs on first
    startup after using micro on DCM2 unless bias card E (closest to pwr
    ctrl) is unplugged at boot.  After that, no problem whether plugged or
    unplugged.  Problem is that I2C lines are pulled low and stay there.
    Where the memory for this is is completely unclear.  Neither boot nor
    power cycle clears problem; the solution is to do a first boot with card
    E out of the system (this won't work on the telescope!).  Need to track
    that down.
    
    Meanwhile
    - presets now work
    - corrected error in not sending I-phase total power back

    Some debugging:
    - Somehow the compiler didn't pick up the atten parts of the flash structs
      defined in zpec.h.  After compiling with zpec.h showing, changing BYTE
      to float and back again, it seemed to pick this up.
    - Modified mon presets to send back bias and atten separately, depending
      on what hardware is hooked up.

    Work on improving error handling and startup
    - Reinserted error handling for failed writes in comap_preset
    - Some work in inits dealing with releasing I2C bus during boot.  This
      could be a problem if an automated system is requesting bus use during
      boot.  More needs to be done.
    - Related, initial dcm2 readouts in init_dcm2 will release bus during boot
      process.  This needs to be resolved.
    - Related, open/close subroutine in init_saddlebags will release bus.
    - Possible solution is to make better use of busyOverride; make this a
      global variable, and set/unset as needed instead of using it in
      subroutine calls.  This means it would replace 0 in all I2C bus
      releases.

    Lab test version, resolving dual-use
    - This version works if either bias or DCM2 system is connected, but not
      both.
    - Resolved various startup problems involving I2C bus lock and bus held
      low after startup on bias system (DCM2 BEX not found).
    - There is probably a better way to do this, mainly by looking for
      something in bias system first.

      "all d 1.0" are both valid.
    - Modified sb_amps functions to return I2C bus error in amp state, if needed.

    Clean up and clarify:
    - Changed bus addresses and switch setting values to #defs for dcm2, sb code
    - Changed format for SB PLL and amp text
    - Shifted DCM2 BEX config to beginning of init_dcm2 and used it as a test
      to see whether DCM2 board responds.  This sets global int "noDCM2" that
      determines whether DCM2 init sequence will scan for modules.
    - Added report back on noDCM2 to ENGR command
    - Updated VER date

    End of day stage, not much progress
    - Tested atten values sent properly
    - Scaled logamp detector output to dBm in parameters file
    - Atten converted at output
    - Struggling with status byte, still -- seems to be modified without
    intention.  Added an initialization in the init file, which fixed things
    for some reason, but side effects of testing it or referencing it
    without changing anything cause problems
    - Trying to get a block command going to set the status byte for
    avoiding bad channels or switches.  Although with init looping through,
    a bad switch will cause the bus to hang no matter what, so it's probably
    a waste of time.

    - Redid LNA command so no argument reads out LNA voltages and currents.
    - Updated date in version.
    - Bias values in flash aren't yet working right; seem to be kind of ok
      (although with extra limiting) in Rx 1-12, but are off beyond that.
